# STEMPOWERING Website

Main website for stempowering.ca. All info about us is on there.
Downloads for experiments, donations too, blah blah.
Also there's an email recording system for when users want to download experiments.

Emails are stored on a database, and can only be viewed with the statistics credentials.
These credentials are hashed here, so good luck reading these emails ;).

There's a games page where we post all of our games aimed at increasing STEM engagement.

Based on the Verti template, info below.

## Original Website Template Info

A super simple + modern responsive website template. Took a slightly different direction
on the mobile version's slide out nav (floating button versus a full on titlebar).

you can use for pretty much whatever.
