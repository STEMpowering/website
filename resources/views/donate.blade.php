            With a rapidly developing society comes the need to educate future generations. STEM education is without a doubt a necessity for students as it opens multiple doors for future opportunities, discoveries, and the advancement of our world. STEM education allows students to develop many essential skills to help them achieve their full potential. Here at STEM Powering, our aim is to provide barrier free access to STEM education opportunities for students who aren't able to participate in these programs.
