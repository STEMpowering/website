# Space Explorer

Learn about about the planets of the solar system, and learn how orbits work! :D
As for orbits, this game guides you through a thought experiment by Newton about a cannon.
This whole thing is in 3D!! yayyyyy!!
The game was made using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the BabylonJS 3D game engine.
